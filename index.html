        <p> These images are snapshots of moments this past October where I felt peace. The first image is a great view of the Northern front of the University of Florida campus from the roof of my apartment building in Midtown. If you click on this image, you will see another peaceful photo of my brother and friend throwing the football at Jacksonville Beach when I visited him this past weekend. </p>
            
        <p>The third image you see rotating back and forth here is of a simply unbelievable sunset I observed from the same location as the first view.</p>

        <p>I took all these photos on my iPhone 14.</p>

        <p>During the creation of this page I learned how to make elements, specifically images, interactive on a page using JavaScript.</p>
